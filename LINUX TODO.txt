What's needed to get Linux working on Moonscraper?

SDL (Plugin)-
  Moonscraper relies on SDL2 for it's input management and it can also be used for messagebox popups
  (see \Assets\Scripts\Engine\OSNative\MessageBox) via the SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox function.
  
  However for Linux, an SDL2 cannot be directly downloaded from https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php, 
  as it states "Please contact your distribution maintainer for updates".
  A runtime library for SDL2 will be needed to be provided, most likely by downloading and compiling the SDL2 source
  and generating the library by hand. This would need to be placed under "\Assets\Plugins\SDL\Linux".
  
Window handle-
  As stated above, SDL can be used for messagebox popups, however this needs an SDL Window to be generated.
  This can most likely be solved by getting Moonscraper's Linux window handle and making an SDL window
  from the function SDL_CreateWindowFrom, similar to how NativeWindow_Windows.cs currently handles it. 
  
  A NativeWindow_Linux skeleton class has already been created, all it needs is implementation of the
  SetApplicationWindowPointerByName method, which takes the expected window name of Moonscraper and is 
  expected to call the base class functionSetWindowPtrFromNative(windowPtr) to set the base class
  sdlWindowPtr variable, which can be passed around to NativeMessageBoxLinux, which has already been set
  up to call SDL's message box function.
  
  A potential method to get said window handle may have a solution here- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42449050/cant-get-a-window-handle
  
FileExplorer-
  The native file explorer has an already untested solution based on https://github.com/gkngkc/UnityStandaloneFileBrowser.
  However the methods I have copy-pasted are untested. It would also be nice to somehow pass the window handle from above
  down to this file explorer so that the windows are parented properly, although not strictly required.
  
  The solution from gkngkc's repro also only provides a 64bit version of the plugin. Meaning without a 32bit version of this then
  Linux builds will have to be restricted to 64bit only. Not that big of a deal, but again, would be nice for completeness' sake.
  
That is what is definitely known to get this working. There may be other issues that may crop up upon getting actual
builds working to to circumstances not allowing me to easily test Linux myself at present.
