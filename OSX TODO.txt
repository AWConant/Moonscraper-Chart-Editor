What's needed to get Moonscraper working on OSX?

Plugins-
  Plugins for bass, native file explorer and SDL2 have been provided, but untested as to how they actually link in with a proper XCode project. 
  
Window handle- 
  NativeWindow_OSX.cs need implementation. 
  
Message box- 
  NativeMessageBoxOSX.cs needs implementation.
  
FileExplorer-
  The native file explorer has an already untested solution based on https://github.com/gkngkc/UnityStandaloneFileBrowser.
  However the methods I have copy-pasted are untested.
