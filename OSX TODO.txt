What's needed to get Moonscraper working on OSX?

Plugins-
  Plugins for bass, native file explorer and SDL2 have been provided, but untested as to how they actually link in with a proper XCode project. 
  
Window handle- 
  NativeWindow_OSX.cs need implementation. We need to get a point to the OSX application's NSWindow which is apparently what SDL is expecting
  when it tries to converting the window pointer to an SDL window. Using the SDL window automatically allows the message box functionality to work.
  
FileExplorer-
  The native file explorer has an already untested solution based on https://github.com/gkngkc/UnityStandaloneFileBrowser.
  However the methods I have copy-pasted are untested.
